          This is a prototype of an automatic hyperbolic art generator and
          educational tool. It creates a regular edge to edge

          represented as a

          >, also known as a hyperbolic tesselation.
        </p>

        <p>
          These were originally described by
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harold_Scott_MacDonald_Coxeter"
            >H. S. M. Coxeter</a
          >, but were made famous by
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M._C._Escher">M.C. Escher</a>
          in his series of Circle Limit woodcuts, back in the era when people
          were known only by their initials and surnames.
        </p>

        <p>
          Currently it can create images similar to Escher’s
          <a href="https://www.wikiart.org/en/m-c-escher/circle-limit-i"
            >Circle Limit I</a
          >. These are regular two colored tilings, defined by the number of
          sides of the polygons, and the number of polygons that meet at each
          vertex.
        </p>

        <p>
          The tiling is created out out of two Euclidean triangular pieces, one
          representing half a white fish, the other half a black fish.
        </p>

          />

        <p>
          I had originally planned to extend this to include irregular tilings
          of several colors, which would allow the creation of the rest oas a
          teaching tool where students could create their own tiles.
        </p>

        <p>
          Unfortunately, creating the tiles so that they match evenly turned out
          to be more difficult than I expected. It’s quite unintuitive since the
          Euclidean triangles get stretched to map onto hyperbolic triangles,
          and the lines of opposing edges don’t match up where you would expect.
          Since the intention was to create a simple educational tool where
          students could quickly create their own designs, this was a bit of a
          showstopper, and I halted development.
        </p>

        <p>
          Note that once you go over around 8 for either values the polygons
          will start to get very stretched at the edges.

          Your current tiling consists of
          <span id="tiling-length">28308</span> hyperbolic polygons.
        </p>

        <p>
          This way this works by mapping the two triangular images to hyperbolic
          triangles (a non-affine texture mapping), and then covering the
          central polygon with them. Then this central polygon is appropriately
          rotated and repeated until the entire plane is covered.
        </p>

        <p>
          The following figure is a {4, 5} tiling - that means 4 sided polygons,
          with 5 meeting at each vertex.

          The algorithm used was first described by
          <a href="https://www.d.umn.edu/~ddunham/">Douglas Dunham</a> and as
          far as I can tell first implemented in software by his PHD student
          Ajit Datar.
        </p>

        <p>
          However, this is almost certainly the first implementation using
          JavaScript and WebGL.
